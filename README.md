# BlinkNote

BlinkNote is a lightweight, privacy-focused web application that allows users to share text, messages, code snippets, notes, or any form of data without any restrictions on size or length. The platform generates a unique 8-character alphanumeric ID and a sharable link, enabling seamless message retrieval and sharing.
